## Abstract
We present a state-of-the-art report on visualization in astrophysics. We survey representative papers from both astrophysics andvisualization and provide a taxonomy of existing approaches based on data analysis tasks. The approaches are classified basedon five categories: data wrangling, data exploration, feature identification, object reconstruction, education, and outreach. Ourunique contribution is to combine the diverse viewpoints from both astronomers and visualization experts to identify challengesand opportunities for visualization in astrophysics. The main goal is to provide a reference point to bring modern data analysisand visualization techniques to the rich datasets in astrophysics.
